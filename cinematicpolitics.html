            <p>Sadly, in the Cinematic Universe, this had complications to it. Marvel had sold the rights to the Mutants to Fox. To circumnavigate this issue, the Cinematic Universe positioned her as a Witch (because of her name, this was believable), and not a Mutant. They also could not utilize the alias Scarlet Witch since the rights belonged to Fox, but the name Wanda Maximoff was still available to be used.</p>

            <p>Recently though, Disney (who now owns Marvel) has worked out an agreement with Fox to utilize some of their resources that have been deemed crucial to the expansion of the Cinematic universe. This has granted Marvel the ability to slowly incorporate the Mutants into the Cinematic universe without infringing on any rights belonging to Fox. Thus, Wanda Maximoff has finally and recently re-earned her long-running alias “The Scarlet Witch” in the Cinematic Universe.</p>
