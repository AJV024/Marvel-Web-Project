            <p>In the comics, Maximoff is known as The Scarlet Witch. She is the daughter of Magneto, and she is considered one of the strongest mutants of all time. Scarlet Witch (as the comic book world knows her as, less Wanda) is a proud member of numerous teams: The Avengers, A-Force, Holy Guard…. The list goes on and on.</p>

        <div class="content-text" style="text-align: right;">
            <p>Due to the fact that the Scarlet Witch is multi-faceted, her affiliations have even been evil. She was in the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, Horsemen of the Apocalypse, and even the main antagonist in The House of M. The House of M is an extraordinary segment of Marvel comic history that takes place after she goes insane from the death of her unborn children, and she rewrites the entire universe – deleting X-Men from history.</p>
