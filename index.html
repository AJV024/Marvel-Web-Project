            <p>Hello! Welcome to my Marvel Web page. While everyone knows of the Avengers, what is lesser known is the differences between how the Original Comics portray the (Enigmatic?) Superheroes, and how (and why) the Cinematic Universe has developed them. This page aims to share these intriguing details about everyone’s beloved heroes.</p>

            <p>In the Cinematic Universe, Wanda Maximoff is an orphan alongside her brother Pietro. Wanda and Pietro’s parents were unmentioned (potentially tying them to the mutants at a later date pending an agreement with Fox). Pietro retained his ability for super speed, but Wanda’s powers were only vaguely referenced: The ability to alter memories, force fields, and telekinesis. All simple powers, assuring that no infringement of rights happened.</p>
