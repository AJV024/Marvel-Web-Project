        <h2>Hello! Welcome to my Marvel Web page.</h2>
        <p>While everyone knows of the Avengers, what is lesser known is the differences between how the Original Comics portray the (Enigmatic?) Superheroes, and how (and why) the Cinematic Universe has developed them. This page aims to share these intriguing details about everyoneâ€™s beloved heroes.</p>

        <h2>The Scarlet Witch - Wanda Maximoff</h2>
        <p>In the comics, she is the daughter of Magneto and one of the strongest mutants of all time.</p>

        <h2>Cinematic Universe Adaptation</h2>
        <p>Sadly, in the Cinematic Universe, this had complications. Marvel had sold the rights to the Mutants to Fox. To circumnavigate this issue, the Cinematic Universe positioned her as a Witch (because of her name, this was believable), and not a Mutant. They also could not utilize the alias Scarlet Witch since the rights belonged to Fox, but the name Wanda Maximoff was still available to be used.</p>
